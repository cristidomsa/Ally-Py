Examples
========

The "example" plugin contains the basic setting for domain and database connection.
The "example-user" puts in a rather simple way for handling user information.

To run this example, it is necessary to go through the next steps:

1) Environment preparation

Some auxiliary libraries are necessary. They are stored in the main repository part,
in the "../distribution/libraries directory".

Copy them into the distribution/libraries subdirectory of this (examples)
directory.

Other steps are relative to this (examples) directory.

2) Building the sources

On the command line, run the:

./build-eggs

If you have not removed the (above mentioned) packages, their compiled egg files
shall be removed from distribution/components and components/plugins directories.

3) Configuration creation

On the command line, run the:

python3 ./distribution/application.py -dump

The configuration *.properties files are created in the "distribution" subdirectory.
You can look into those files and tweak them.

4) Plugin avoiding

Some Ally-Py packages prevent proper work unless the application-specific security
packages are developed. Thus Ally-Py security-related packages shall not be loaded
when these simple examples should be run.

To deactivate those packages, set in ./distribution/application.properties
the option 'excluded_plugins', see below.

excluded_plugins:
- components/service-gateway
- components/service-gateway-recaptcha
- plugins/security-rbac

5) Running the system

On the command line, run the:

python3 ./distribution/application.py

When running the first time, it shall take some time for the initial database
preparation. The "example" database is (sqlite3 by default) located at
distribution/workspace/shared/example.db

The REST interface is available at

http://localhost:8080/resources/
