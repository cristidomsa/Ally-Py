About distribution-manager:
- Collect package information from __setup__(__plugin__)/__init__.py files in each package.
- Generate eggs to path
- Generate setup.py and setup.cfg files used for pypi upload
- Publish package to pypi (requires auth)

!!!IMPORTANT!!!
Only use distribution-manager if your intention is to publish NEW components/plugins versions to pypi.

Usage (Ubuntu):
1. create in your home directory pypi config file:

echo "[distutils]
index-servers =
    pypi

[pypi]
username:Sourcefabric
password:Sofabulous#78" > ~/.pypirc

2. Build and publish components and/or plugins:
(python 3.2.5 is required, for now)

python3 distribution.py --location [path] 
				        --location [path] --components 
				        --location [path] --plugins

Help: 
  path         - the path where the eggs will be deployed
  --components - build and publish only ally-py components
  --plugins    - build and publish only ally-py plugins 


For installing ally-py core with deps (Ubuntu):

1. Download components requirements file

wget https://github.com/cristidomsa/Ally-Py/blob/packaging_ally/requirements/components.txt

2. Install compiling dependencies

sudo apt-get install libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt1.1 libxslt1-dev 

3. Install Ally-py core (pip-3.2 needed - http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html) 

cd requirements
pip-3.2 install --target [path_to_desired_location] -r components.txt

4. Configure Ally-py

cd [path_to_desired_location]
python3 application.py -dump
